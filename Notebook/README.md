## 1. ReadDocument

The notebook "ReadDocument" focuses on analyzing and integrating insights with question answering from a retrieved document related to Personal Management Finance. Its primary aim is to understand how demographic characteristics influence financial behaviors, such as spending, saving, debt management, and retirement planning.

## 2. Hack together-ML

This notebook presents a comprehensive machine-learning project aimed at forecasting results based on income demographics. It is structured as follows:

- **Library Imports:** Starts with importing essential Python libraries crucial for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn components.
  
- **Data Preparation:** Outlines preprocessing steps necessary for machine learning, including data splitting with `train_test_split`.
  
- **Model Development:** Details the construction and training of three machine-learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Gradient Boosting Classifier.
  
- **Model Evaluation:** Defines an evaluation function to assess each model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score, and a confusion matrix.
  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Includes optimizing the Gradient Boosting Classifier using GridSearchCV for accurate predictions.
  
- **Advanced Ensemble Methods:** Experiments with XGBoost, focusing on model tuning and performance assessment.
  
- **Fairness Consideration:** Incorporates fairness analysis with fairlearn metrics, particularly examining the sensitive attribute of race.
  
- **Visualizations:** Features visual representations like a confusion matrix heatmap to provide insights into the models' prediction accuracy.

This notebook serves as a detailed guide for executing a machine learning project, emphasizing predictive accuracy, advanced modeling techniques, and ethical AI practices.

## 3. DS and EDA

This notebook offers an in-depth look at Descriptive Statistics and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), applied to a dataset rich in socio-economic and demographic information. It demonstrates how these methods reveal patterns and insights, particularly among different age groups, education levels, and employment sectors, focusing on private sector jobs or professional specialties. The analysis underscores the significance of meticulous data cleaning and the potential for predictive modeling, with attention to outliers and adjustments for possible biases in marital status, gender, and race.

## 4. Data Cleaning Procedure

The notebook elaborates on the data cleaning process for the 'IncomeDemographicsAnalysis.csv' file, emphasizing the standardization of column names to adhere to specific criteria (UTF-8 encoding, length restriction, acceptable characters) and the transformation of data for enhanced visualization and reporting, particularly with Power BI. This step is crucial for preparing the data for effective analysis and clear visual representation, facilitating an informative Power BI dashboard creation.
