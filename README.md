## Income Demographic Analysis : A Comprehensive Approach to Understanding Financial Behaviors

Our project delves into the nuanced relationship between individual demographic attributes and their financial behaviors, focusing on income levels, spending, saving, debt management, and retirement planning. We aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of financial behaviors by merging insights from document analysis and Machine learning with demographic data.

## Architecture


**Flow**:
1. **First Step:** Initiate the process by executing a notebook via code specifically designed for cognitive purposes and acquiring data from an external source.

2. **Second Step:** Submit a request to Azure Cognitive Search through an API, ensuring an index is created and the search information fabric is in place.

3. **Third Step:** Import the gathered data into the lakehouse, facilitating information retrieval using Azure OpenAI integrated within Microsoft's ecosystem.

4. **Fourth Step:** Proceed to upload the data into the lakehouse for comprehensive analysis. This involves utilizing the same lakehouse as before but for a distinct objective. The data, once fetched by Azure OpenAI, is uploaded for further examination with various tools or services, including Data Science, Statistical Notebook, or ML Notebook.

5. **Fifth Step:** Implement summary code to derive statistical results.

6. **Sixth Step:** Produce a report using Copilot, subsequent to the data cleansing process.

7. **Seventh Step:** Develop an ML model dedicated to prediction purposes.


### Document Analysis: Integration of Retrieved Information

We integrate insights from document analysis with demographic data to:

- **Budgeting and Financial Planning:** Analyzing how demographic factors influence individual budgeting habits and financial planning.
- **Investment Strategies:** Exploring the correlation between demographic attributes and investment preferences.
- **Debt Management:** Examining different demographic groups' debt accumulation and repayment strategies.
- **Retirement Planning:** Assessing the impact of demographic traits on retirement preparation and savings.

### Power BI of Income Demographics

Our Power BI report highlights income demographic trends, revealing patterns related to age, gender, occupation, race, and education:

- **Age and Gender:** Insights into the correlation between age, gender, and income levels.
- **Occupation and Working Hours:** Analysis of occupational roles and work hours across income levels.
- **Race and Income:** Examination of income distribution across racial groups.
- **Education and Capital Gain/Loss:** Connection between education levels and financial outcomes.


### Machine Learning Interpretation and Application

- **Education as a Key Predictor:** Advocating for educational initiatives to enhance earning potential.
- **Age Reflecting Experience:** Highlighting experience, as indicated by age, as a significant income predictor.
- **Hours Worked Indicating Compensation:** Discussing the link between work hours and income, advocating for fair compensation and work-life balance.

### Research Implications and Technological Considerations

- **Research Implications:** Groundwork for studies on income disparities, informing policy and economic strategies.
- **Technological Considerations:** Using data analytics and machine learning to improve predictive accuracy of income forecasts.

Our project underscores the importance of integrating document analysis with demographic data, enabling informed decisions and strategic planning in socio-economic policymaking.
